\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose that physical law is what self-consistency looks like: the universe is the fixed point of a constraint requiring that geometry and the quantum fields it hosts mutually determine each other. Gravity is not an independent degree of freedom to be quantized but a constraint---the demand that the block spacetime be self-consistent. The semiclassical Einstein equation, together with its stochastic extension via the noise kernel, implements this constraint at tree level in the stochastic gravity formalism of Hu and Verdaguer.

We prove that self-consistent solutions exist: exactly in cosmology via the trace anomaly, perturbatively near any classical solution via Banach contraction with constant $\kappa \sim (m/M_P)^2 \ll 1$, and conditionally in the general case via the Schauder theorem. The Planck scale emerges as the natural validity boundary where $\kappa \to 1$.

The stochastic extension yields a gravitational decoherence rate $\Gamma \sim G^2 m^4 / (\hbar^2 c d)$, suppressed by $(m/M_P)^2$ relative to the Di\'osi--Penrose prediction. We show that the Di\'osi--Penrose timescale \emph{does not follow} from semiclassical self-consistency and requires postulates beyond the Einstein equation. The framework further predicts null results for BMV entanglement at the quantum gravity rate. Both predictions are falsifiable.
\end{abstract}

%======================================================================
\section{Motivation}
%======================================================================

Consider the possibility that physical law is self-consistency. Not a dynamical rule imposed from outside, but the demand that the universe---the complete block spacetime and the quantum fields it hosts---be a fixed point: every part determining every other part with no remainder and no contradiction.

If this is taken seriously, gravity is not a force. It is a constraint. The geometry of spacetime is whatever it must be for the quantum fields propagating on it to source, through their stress-energy, exactly that geometry. The block is the ontology: the complete four-dimensional solution, not a three-dimensional state evolving forward. The arrow of time is a geometric feature of the block---the direction in which entropy increases---not a primitive dynamical ingredient.

This view has concrete mathematical content. The semiclassical Einstein equation is precisely a self-consistency condition: the geometry and the quantum state must be mutually compatible. Its stochastic extension via the noise kernel promotes this from a mean-field constraint to one that includes quantum fluctuations. Together, they constitute tree-level quantum gravity expressed in the stochastic gravity formalism of Hu and Verdaguer~\cite{hu_verdaguer}, which reproduces the full spectrum of inflationary perturbations without quantizing the metric~\cite{roura_verdaguer}.

The position that the semiclassical Einstein equation may be fundamental dates to M\o ller (1962) and Rosenfeld (1963), and has been developed in its most sophisticated modern form by Oppenheim~\cite{oppenheim}. What this paper adds to the program is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Rigorous fixed-point existence proofs establishing that the self-consistency equation has solutions, with a quantitative contraction constant $\kappa \sim (m/M_P)^2$ and a natural Planck-scale validity boundary.
\item A derivation of the gravitational decoherence rate that actually follows from semiclassical self-consistency, which turns out to be much slower than the commonly cited Di\'osi--Penrose rate.
\item A demonstration that the Di\'osi--Penrose timescale requires physics beyond the semiclassical Einstein equation---a result that sharpens the theoretical landscape for gravitational decoherence experiments.
\end{enumerate}

%======================================================================
\section{Core Proposal}
%======================================================================

\subsection{The Self-Consistency Equation}

The fundamental equation of the framework is:
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu}[g] = 8\pi G \, \langle \Psi | \hat{T}_{\mu\nu}[g] | \Psi \rangle
\label{eq:sce}
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mu\nu}[g]$ is the Einstein tensor computed from the geometry $g_{\mu\nu}$, $|\Psi\rangle$ is the global quantum state of all matter fields, and $\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}[g]$ is the stress-energy tensor operator defined on the geometry $g$. The expectation value is computed on the same geometry that the left side describes.

This is not a dynamical equation in the usual sense. It is a fixed-point condition: we seek the geometry $g_{\mu\nu}$ such that the quantum state it hosts, evolving on it, sources exactly that geometry.

\subsection{Axioms}

\begin{axiom}[Ontology]
The fundamental entities are quantum fields $\hat{\phi}_i$ defined on a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold $(\mathcal{M}, g_{\mu\nu})$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Geometry as constraint]
The geometry is not independently dynamical. Its mean is determined by the self-consistency condition~\eqref{eq:sce}; its fluctuations are determined by the noise kernel of quantum stress-energy (eq.~\ref{eq:noise_kernel}). Both the mean geometry and its stochastic corrections are sourced entirely by quantum matter---no independent gravitational degrees of freedom contribute. The noise kernel carries quantum correlations of the stress-energy; at tree level, the resulting stochastic metric fluctuations are isomorphic to graviton exchange~\cite{hu_verdaguer}. The framework therefore constitutes tree-level quantum gravity expressed in stochastic language.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Global solution]
The triple $(\mathcal{M}, g_{\mu\nu}, |\Psi\rangle)$ is solved as a fixed-point problem over the entire manifold. The solution is the block---the complete spacetime.
\end{axiom}

%======================================================================
\section{Fixed-Point Existence}
\label{sec:fixedpoint}
%======================================================================

This section contains the framework's core mathematical contribution. The self-consistency equation~\eqref{eq:sce} is a fixed-point condition; the question of whether the framework is well-defined reduces to whether fixed points exist. We establish existence at three levels of generality.

\subsection{The Map}

Define $\mathcal{F}: g_{\mu\nu} \mapsto g'_{\mu\nu}$ by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a trial geometry $g$, construct the QFT on $(\mathcal{M}, g)$ and identify the physical state $|\Psi_g\rangle$ via the Hadamard condition.
\item Compute $S_{\mu\nu}[g] \equiv 8\pi G \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle_{g,\text{ren}}$.
\item Solve $G_{\mu\nu}[g'] = S_{\mu\nu}[g]$ for $g'$.
\end{enumerate}
We seek $g^*$ such that $\mathcal{F}(g^*) = g^*$.

\subsection{Cosmological Fixed Point: Exact Solution}

\begin{theorem}[Starobinsky, 1980 \cite{starobinsky}]
The self-consistency equation on FRW spacetime with conformal matter admits an exact de~Sitter solution $a(t) = a_0 e^{H_0 t}$ with:
\begin{equation}
H_0^2 = \frac{180\pi}{G |a_2|}
\end{equation}
where $a_2$ depends on the field content. This solution is a stable attractor: perturbations $\delta H$ are exponentially damped.
\end{theorem}

\noindent\emph{Proof sketch.} For constant $H$, all time derivatives vanish. The trace anomaly~\cite{capper_duff} reduces to $\langle \hat{T}^\mu{}_\mu \rangle = -a_2 H_0^4 / 120\pi^2$. The Friedmann equation yields $H_0$. Stability follows from the linearized equation for $\delta H$~\cite{starobinsky}.

This constitutes an existence proof: the de~Sitter geometry, when used to compute the quantum stress-energy of fields living on it, sources exactly itself.

\subsection{Perturbative Fixed Point: Banach Contraction}

Let $\bar{g}$ be a solution of the classical Einstein equations. Define the quantum-corrected map:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}(g) = \bar{g} + (G^{\bar{g}}_{\text{lin}})^{-1} \left[ 8\pi G \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle^{(\text{quantum})}_g \right]
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}[Perturbative existence]
The map $\mathcal{F}$ is a contraction in the $H^s$ norm with contraction constant:
\begin{equation}
\kappa \sim \frac{1}{2\pi} \left( \frac{m}{M_P} \right)^2 \ell_P^2 R
\label{eq:kappa}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the field mass, $M_P = 1/\sqrt{G}$ is the Planck mass, and $R$ is the background curvature scale.
\end{theorem}

\noindent\emph{Proof sketch.} The Lipschitz constant of $\mathcal{F}$ is bounded by $\kappa = 8\pi G \| (G_{\text{lin}})^{-1} \|_{\text{op}} \cdot \| \delta \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle / \delta g \|_{\text{op}}$. The response kernel has been computed~\cite{horowitz,phillips_hu}; its operator norm scales as $\hbar m^2 c / (4\pi)^2$. Combined with the inverse linearized Einstein operator norm $\sim 1/R$, this yields the result.

For all known particles, $\kappa \ll 1$:

\medskip
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Particle & Mass (kg) & $\kappa \sim (m/M_P)^2$ \\
\midrule
Electron & $9.1 \times 10^{-31}$ & $\sim 10^{-45}$ \\
Proton & $1.7 \times 10^{-27}$ & $\sim 10^{-39}$ \\
Top quark & $3.1 \times 10^{-25}$ & $\sim 10^{-34}$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\medskip

By the Banach fixed-point theorem, a unique self-consistent solution exists in a neighborhood of any classical solution, and the iterative scheme converges exponentially.

\subsection{Non-Perturbative Existence via Schauder}

For strong-field regimes, we invoke the Schauder fixed-point theorem~\cite{schauder}. If $\mathcal{F}$ maps a convex, compact subset $K$ of the metric space into itself, and $\mathcal{F}$ is continuous, then $\mathcal{F}$ has a fixed point. Continuity follows from the continuous dependence of the Hadamard parametrix on the metric~\cite{radzikowski} and the well-posedness of the Einstein equations~\cite{choquet_bruhat}. Compactness of $K$ in the appropriate Sobolev space follows from the Rellich--Kondrachov theorem.

We note that a fully rigorous Schauder argument requires specifying the convex compact subset (including gauge fixing) and verifying $\mathcal{F}$-invariance---nontrivial steps in Lorentzian signature with diffeomorphism invariance. We regard this as a conditional result pending further functional-analytic development.

\subsection{Breakdown at the Planck Scale}

The analysis fails when $R \sim \ell_P$: the contraction constant $\kappa$ approaches 1, and neither the perturbative nor the Schauder argument applies. The Planck scale emerges as the natural boundary of the framework's validity---not imposed by hand, but derived from the mathematics of fixed-point convergence.

%======================================================================
\section{Gravitational Decoherence from Self-Consistent Fluctuations}
\label{sec:decoherence}
%======================================================================

We now derive the gravitational decoherence rate that follows from the self-consistency framework. This requires careful analysis, as the result differs from what has been widely assumed.

\subsection{The Deterministic Equation Does Not Decohere}

\begin{proposition}
The deterministic self-consistency equation~\eqref{eq:sce} does not produce decoherence for spatially separated superpositions.
\end{proposition}

\noindent\emph{Proof.} Consider a mass $m$ in superposition $|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|L\rangle + |R\rangle)$, with $|L\rangle$ and $|R\rangle$ spatially separated by $d$. The density matrix is:
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|L\rangle\langle L| + |R\rangle\langle R| + |L\rangle\langle R| + |R\rangle\langle L|\right)
\end{equation}
The self-consistency equation sources the geometry via $\langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle = \mathrm{Tr}(\rho \, \hat{T}_{\mu\nu})$. For spatially separated wavepackets, the stress-energy operator is local: $\langle L | \hat{T}_{\mu\nu}(x) | R \rangle \approx 0$ when $x$ is in the support of either wavepacket. Therefore:
\begin{equation}
\langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle \approx \frac{1}{2} T^{(L)}_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2} T^{(R)}_{\mu\nu}
\label{eq:tmunu_avg}
\end{equation}
independent of the off-diagonal coherence $\rho_{LR}$. The geometry determined by eq.~\eqref{eq:sce} is therefore identical whether the system is in a coherent superposition or a classical mixture. Since the Hamiltonian governing the matter evolution depends only on this geometry, the time evolution of $\rho_{LR}$ is purely oscillatory (a phase rotation), not decaying. The deterministic self-consistency equation is blind to coherence and cannot destroy it. \hfill$\square$

This result has a simple physical interpretation: the self-consistency equation extracts $\langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ from the quantum state and feeds it back as a classical geometry. For separated wavepackets, this expectation value carries no information about the quantum coherence between branches. A classical geometry that carries no branch-distinguishing information cannot selectively suppress the off-diagonal elements of $\rho$.

\subsection{The Stochastic Extension}

The semiclassical equation uses the mean $\langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle$, but quantum operators fluctuate. The natural next-order correction incorporates these fluctuations through the Einstein--Langevin equation~\cite{hu_verdaguer}:
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu}[g] = 8\pi G \left( \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle_g + \xi_{\mu\nu} \right)
\label{eq:einstein_langevin}
\end{equation}
where $\xi_{\mu\nu}$ is a stochastic tensor with zero mean and correlator given by the noise kernel:
\begin{equation}
\langle \xi_{\mu\nu}(x) \, \xi_{\alpha\beta}(x') \rangle = N_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}(x, x') \equiv \frac{1}{2} \langle \{ \delta\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}(x), \, \delta\hat{T}_{\alpha\beta}(x') \} \rangle
\label{eq:noise_kernel}
\end{equation}
with $\delta\hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \equiv \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} - \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle$.

This is not an additional postulate. It is the leading fluctuation correction to any mean-field theory, analogous to the passage from Hartree to Hartree-Fock in atomic physics or from the Boltzmann equation to the Langevin equation in statistical mechanics. The noise kernel $N_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$ is computable from the quantum state and the geometry~\cite{phillips_hu}.

\subsection{Decoherence Rate from Stochastic Geometry}

The stochastic metric fluctuations induce a random potential that differs between branches. For a mass $m$ in superposition of size $d$, the Newtonian potential fluctuation at each branch location is $\delta\Phi_{L,R} = -(c^2/2) \, \delta g_{00}(x_{L,R})$. The off-diagonal element of the density matrix, averaged over stochastic realizations, evolves as:
\begin{equation}
|\rho_{LR}(t)| = |\rho_{LR}(0)| \, \exp\!\left( -\frac{1}{2\hbar^2} \int_0^t \!\!\int_0^t \langle [\delta V_L(t') - \delta V_R(t')][\delta V_L(t'') - \delta V_R(t'')] \rangle \, dt' \, dt'' \right)
\label{eq:decoherence_gaussian}
\end{equation}
where $\delta V_{L,R} = m \, \delta\Phi_{L,R}$ are the stochastic potential fluctuations at the two branch locations, and the Gaussian average over noise realizations gives the exponential form.

The potential difference correlator is determined by the noise kernel through the linearized Einstein equation. The stochastic metric perturbation satisfies:
\begin{equation}
G^{\text{lin}}_{\mu\nu}[\delta g] = 8\pi G \, \xi_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
In the Newtonian limit, $\delta\Phi(x) = -G \int \xi_{00}(x') / |x - x'| \, d^3x'$, and the potential difference correlator becomes:
\begin{equation}
\langle [\delta V_L - \delta V_R]^2 \rangle \sim m^2 G^2 \!\!\int\!\!\int \frac{K(x,x')}{|x - x_L| \cdot |x' - x_L|} \, d^3x \, d^3x' - (L \leftrightarrow R) + \text{cross terms}
\end{equation}
where $K(x,x') \equiv N_{0000}(x,x')$ is the energy-density fluctuation kernel.

The magnitude of $K$ is set by the quantum variance of the stress-energy. For a mass $m$ in superposition, the dominant contribution is from the variance of the mass distribution itself: $K \sim m^2 c^4 / \sigma^3$ where $\sigma$ is the wavepacket size. The noise correlation time is set by the light-crossing time $\tau_{\text{corr}} \sim d/c$.

Collecting factors, the decoherence rate evaluates to:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\text{sc}} \sim \frac{G^2 m^4}{\hbar^2 c \, d}
\label{eq:gamma_sc}
\end{equation}

This can be expressed in terms of the Di\'osi--Penrose rate $\Gamma_{DP} = Gm^2/(\hbar d)$ as:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\text{sc}} \sim \left(\frac{m}{M_P}\right)^2 \Gamma_{DP}
\label{eq:suppression}
\end{equation}

The suppression factor $(m/M_P)^2$ is the same contraction constant $\kappa$ that appears in the fixed-point analysis (eq.~\ref{eq:kappa} with $\ell_P^2 R \sim 1$). This is not a coincidence: both the convergence rate of the fixed-point map and the decoherence rate from stochastic fluctuations are controlled by the same dimensionless ratio measuring the strength of quantum backreaction on geometry.

\subsection{Numerical Consequences}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
System & Mass (kg) & $d$ & $\tau_{\text{sc}} = 1/\Gamma_{\text{sc}}$ & $\tau_{DP} = \hbar d / Gm^2$ \\
\midrule
Electron & $9.1 \times 10^{-31}$ & 1 nm & $\sim 10^{72}$ s & $\sim 10^{27}$ s \\
Microdiamond & $10^{-14}$ & 100 $\mu$m & $\sim 10^{13}$ s & 1.6 s \\
Planck mass & $2.2 \times 10^{-8}$ & 1 $\mu$m & $\sim 10^{-14}$ s & $\sim 10^{-14}$ s \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The two rates converge at the Planck mass ($M_P = 2.18 \times 10^{-8}$~kg), where $\kappa \sim 1$ and the framework reaches its validity boundary---the decoherence timescale drops to femtoseconds, consistent with Planck-scale physics. For all sub-Planckian masses, the self-consistent decoherence rate is unobservably slow: even for a microdiamond ($m \sim 10^{-14}$~kg), $\tau_{\text{sc}} \sim 10^{13}$~s ($\sim 317{,}000$ years), compared to the Di\'osi--Penrose prediction of 1.6~s.

\subsection{Noise Kernel Evaluation for Experimental Geometries}
\label{sec:noise_kernel_eval}

The scaling estimate~\eqref{eq:gamma_sc} treats the mass as a point particle. Experimental targets---microdiamonds with $N \sim 10^{12}$ atoms, optomechanically levitated nanospheres, proposed space-based test masses~\cite{maqro}---are composite objects of radius $R$. We now evaluate the noise kernel for these geometries, confirming the conditions under which the point-particle scaling applies and computing the leading corrections from finite size. Throughout this subsection, we label each result as \emph{rigorous}, \emph{sketch}, or \emph{conjecture} following the standards of Section~7.

\subsubsection{Noise kernel for a rigid-body superposition {\normalfont (rigorous)}}

Consider a rigid body of mass $m$ with mass-density distribution $\rho(\mathbf{x})$, placed in a center-of-mass superposition $|\psi\rangle = (|L\rangle + |R\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ with branches separated by $\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{x}_L - \mathbf{x}_R$. In branch $|L\rangle$, the body has density $\rho_L(\mathbf{x}) = \rho(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_L)$; in branch $|R\rangle$, $\rho_R(\mathbf{x}) = \rho(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_R)$. The stress-energy operator satisfies $\hat{T}_{00}(\mathbf{x}) = c^2 \rho(\mathbf{x} - \hat{\mathbf{X}}_{\text{CM}})$.

The expectation value is:
\begin{equation}
\langle \hat{T}_{00}(\mathbf{x}) \rangle = \frac{c^2}{2}\bigl[\rho_L(\mathbf{x}) + \rho_R(\mathbf{x})\bigr]
\end{equation}
Computing the noise kernel $N_{0000}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \langle \hat{T}_{00}(\mathbf{x}) \hat{T}_{00}(\mathbf{x}') \rangle - \langle \hat{T}_{00}(\mathbf{x}) \rangle \langle \hat{T}_{00}(\mathbf{x}') \rangle$ directly:
\begin{equation}
N_{0000}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \frac{c^4}{4} \, \Delta\rho(\mathbf{x}) \, \Delta\rho(\mathbf{x}')
\label{eq:noise_kernel_extended}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\rho(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \rho_L(\mathbf{x}) - \rho_R(\mathbf{x})$ is the mass-density difference between branches. This follows from $\langle \hat{T}_{00} \hat{T}_{00}' \rangle = \frac{c^4}{2}(\rho_L \rho_L' + \rho_R \rho_R')$ (each branch contributes its own product) while $\langle \hat{T}_{00} \rangle \langle \hat{T}_{00}' \rangle = \frac{c^4}{4}(\rho_L + \rho_R)(\rho_L' + \rho_R')$.

\subsubsection{Potential difference and the gravitational self-energy {\normalfont (rigorous)}}

In the Newtonian limit, $\delta\Phi(\mathbf{x}) = -(G/c^2) \int \xi_{00}(\mathbf{z}) / |\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}| \, d^3z$. Because the noise kernel~\eqref{eq:noise_kernel_extended} factorizes, the potential correlator also factorizes:
\begin{equation}
\langle \delta\Phi(\mathbf{x}) \, \delta\Phi(\mathbf{y}) \rangle = \frac{G^2}{4} \, U(\mathbf{x}) \, U(\mathbf{y})
\label{eq:phi_correlator}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
U(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \int \frac{\Delta\rho(\mathbf{z})}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}|} \, d^3z
\end{equation}
is the Newtonian potential of the mass-density difference $\Delta\rho$ (without the factor of $-G$). The equal-time potential difference variance is:
\begin{equation}
\langle (\delta V_L - \delta V_R)^2 \rangle = \frac{G^2 m^2}{4} \bigl[U(\mathbf{x}_L) - U(\mathbf{x}_R)\bigr]^2
\label{eq:dV_variance}
\end{equation}

\noindent\textit{Evaluation for a uniform sphere.} For a sphere of radius $R$ and uniform density $\rho_0 = 3m/(4\pi R^3)$, displaced by $d \equiv |\mathbf{d}|$, we need the potential of $\Delta\rho$ evaluated at the branch locations. The self-potential at the center of the body is $U_{\text{self}} = \int \rho_0(u)/|u| \, d^3u = 3m/(2R)$, and the cross-potential for $d > 2R$ (non-overlapping bodies) is $U_{\text{cross}}(d) = m/d$. By symmetry, $U(\mathbf{x}_R) = -U(\mathbf{x}_L)$, giving:
\begin{equation}
U(\mathbf{x}_L) - U(\mathbf{x}_R) = 2\!\left(\frac{3m}{2R} - \frac{m}{d}\right) = m\!\left(\frac{3}{R} - \frac{2}{d}\right)
\label{eq:U_diff}
\end{equation}

This result connects directly to the gravitational self-energy of $\Delta\rho$. Define:
\begin{equation}
E_\Delta \equiv \frac{G}{2} \!\int\!\!\int \frac{\Delta\rho(\mathbf{x}) \, \Delta\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \, d^3x \, d^3x' = G\!\left(\frac{6m^2}{5R} - \frac{m^2}{d}\right) \quad (d > 2R)
\label{eq:E_delta}
\end{equation}
which is the same integral that determines the Di\'osi--Penrose decoherence timescale $\tau_{DP} = \hbar / E_\Delta$. The potential difference variance~\eqref{eq:dV_variance} can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\langle (\delta V_L - \delta V_R)^2 \rangle = \frac{G^2 m^2}{4}\!\left(\frac{3m}{R} - \frac{2m}{d}\right)^{\!2} = \frac{25}{16} \, E_\Delta^2 \!\left(1 + \mathcal{O}(R/d)\right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Gravitational form factor {\normalfont (rigorous)}}

The Fourier transform of the body's density profile defines a gravitational form factor:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F}(k) \equiv \frac{1}{m} \int \rho(\mathbf{x}) \, e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}} \, d^3x
\end{equation}
For a uniform sphere of radius $R$:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F}(kR) = \frac{3[\sin(kR) - kR \cos(kR)]}{(kR)^3}
\label{eq:form_factor}
\end{equation}
with $\tilde{F}(0) = 1$ (normalization) and $\tilde{F}(kR) \to 0$ for $kR \gg 1$. The gravitational self-energy integral~\eqref{eq:E_delta} can be written in Fourier space as:
\begin{equation}
E_\Delta = \frac{2 G m^2}{\pi} \int_0^\infty |\tilde{F}(kR)|^2 \left(1 - \frac{\sin kd}{kd}\right) dk
\label{eq:E_delta_fourier}
\end{equation}
The factor $(1 - \sin(kd)/(kd))$ encodes the incomplete overlap between branches: it vanishes at $k = 0$ (reflecting mass conservation, $\int \Delta\rho \, d^3x = 0$) and saturates to 1 for $kd \gg 1$. The form factor $|\tilde{F}|^2$ provides a UV cutoff at $k \sim 1/R$.

\medskip\noindent\textit{Three regimes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $d \gg R$: The integral is dominated by $k \sim 1/R$, where $(1 - \sin kd/(kd)) \approx 1$. The form factor controls the result: $E_\Delta \approx 6Gm^2/(5R)$, the gravitational self-energy of the body. This is the point-particle limit for the \emph{body} (not the atoms).

\item $d \sim R$: Both the form factor and the overlap factor contribute. $E_\Delta$ transitions smoothly from the self-energy--dominated regime to the interaction regime.

\item $d \ll R$: The overlap factor restricts the integral to $k \gtrsim 1/d \gg 1/R$. In this regime $|\tilde{F}|^2 \ll 1$, and $E_\Delta \propto d^2/R^5$, parametrically suppressed by $(d/R)^2$ relative to the self-energy.
\end{itemize}

For all current experimental proposals---microdiamonds with $d/R \sim 2{,}800$, levitated nanospheres with $d/R \sim 5$--$10$, and MAQRO test masses with $d/R \sim 0.5$---the relevant regime ranges from $d \gg R$ (BMV) to $d \sim R$ (MAQRO). Only for MAQRO does the form factor provide significant corrections.

\subsubsection{Rigid body vs.\ independent atoms {\normalfont (rigorous)}}

The factorized noise kernel~\eqref{eq:noise_kernel_extended} assumes all $N$ atoms move coherently in the center-of-mass superposition. This gives $E_\Delta \propto m_{\text{total}}^2$. If instead the atoms moved independently (each in its own superposition), the stress-energy fluctuations would be uncorrelated between atoms, and the noise kernel would decompose as a sum over atomic contributions: $N_{0000} = \sum_{i=1}^N N_{0000}^{(i)}$, giving $E_\Delta \propto N m_{\text{atom}}^2 = m_{\text{total}} \cdot m_{\text{atom}}$---a factor of $N$ smaller.

The rigid-body scaling ($m_{\text{total}}^2$) is appropriate for the center-of-mass superpositions created in all proposed experiments~\cite{bose,maqro}: the spin-dependent magnetic gradient (BMV) or coherent scattering (MAQRO) displaces the entire crystal as a unit. The $m_{\text{total}}^4$ scaling of $\Gamma_{\text{sc}}$ (two factors of $m^2$, one from the noise kernel and one from the gravitational coupling) is therefore correct for these geometries.

\subsubsection{Numerical evaluation {\normalfont (rigorous numerics, sketch for $\Gamma_{\text{sc}}$)}}

We evaluate $E_\Delta$ and the resulting timescales for three experimental platforms. For each, we compute both the Di\'osi--Penrose timescale $\tau_{DP} = \hbar/E_\Delta$ using the extended-body self-energy~\eqref{eq:E_delta} and the self-consistent timescale $\tau_{\text{sc}} \sim (M_P/m)^2 \, \tau_{DP}$, maintaining the $(m/M_P)^2$ suppression from the $G^2$ scaling.

\noindent Several features are notable:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Di\'osi--Penrose timescales for extended bodies differ significantly from point-particle estimates. For the BMV microdiamond, the extended-body $\tau_{DP} \approx 1.2$~ms (dominated by the gravitational self-energy $6Gm^2/(5R)$) is much shorter than the point-particle estimate $\tau_{DP}^{(\text{pt})} = \hbar d/(Gm^2) \approx 4$~s at the same separation $d = 250\;\mu$m. This factor-of-$\sim\!3{,}300$ difference reflects the dominance of the self-energy over the interaction energy when $d \gg R$.

\item The self-consistent timescale $\tau_{\text{sc}}$ remains unobservably long for all platforms. Even with the shorter $\tau_{DP}$ from the extended-body calculation, the $(M_P/m)^2$ suppression factor of $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ for the microdiamond pushes $\tau_{\text{sc}}$ to $\sim 200$~years.

\item For MAQRO ($d/R \approx 0.5$), the form factor~\eqref{eq:form_factor} suppresses $E_\Delta$ by an additional factor of $\sim 12$ relative to the $d \gg R$ limit. The integral~\eqref{eq:E_delta_fourier} must be evaluated numerically for this geometry.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Temporal structure of the decoherence {\normalfont (conjecture)}}

The results above determine the equal-time potential difference variance~\eqref{eq:dV_variance}. The time dependence of the decoherence---and hence whether it is exponential (with rate $\Gamma$) or Gaussian (with timescale $\tau_{\text{coh}}$)---depends on the temporal correlation function of the noise:
\begin{equation}
C_V(\tau) = \langle [\delta V_L(t) - \delta V_R(t)][\delta V_L(t+\tau) - \delta V_R(t+\tau)] \rangle
\end{equation}
If $C_V(\tau)$ decays on a timescale $\tau_c \ll t$, the decoherence is exponential with $\Gamma \sim C_V(0) \tau_c / (2\hbar^2)$. If $C_V(\tau) \approx C_V(0)$ (static noise), the suppression is Gaussian: $|\rho_{LR}(t)| \sim \exp(-C_V(0) t^2 / (2\hbar^2))$.

For the center-of-mass degree of freedom of a massive body, the correlation time of the noise kernel~\eqref{eq:noise_kernel_extended} is set by the quantum dynamics of the superposition state. In the absence of external decoherence, a stationary superposition produces time-independent $\Delta\rho$ and hence time-independent noise---formally, $\tau_c \to \infty$. This yields Gaussian suppression with a characteristic timescale:
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\text{coh}} = \frac{\hbar\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{C_V(0)}} \sim \frac{\hbar R}{G m^2}
\label{eq:tau_coh}
\end{equation}
which for the microdiamond gives $\tau_{\text{coh}} \sim 1$~ms---coinciding with $\tau_{DP}$, as expected from the shared dependence on $E_\Delta$.

The suppression by $(m/M_P)^2$ enters when the stochastic geometry is treated as a fluctuating field with its own dynamical timescale. In the Einstein--Langevin formalism, the noise correlation time is set by the causal structure of the gravitational propagator, not by the matter dynamics. Whether this yields $\tau_c \sim d/c$ (as assumed in the scaling argument for eq.~\ref{eq:gamma_sc}) or a different timescale requires a full evaluation of the retarded gravitational Green function with the noise kernel~\eqref{eq:noise_kernel_extended}---a calculation that goes beyond the Newtonian limit used here. The $(m/M_P)^2$ suppression of $\Gamma_{\text{sc}}$ relative to $\Gamma_{DP}$ is robust regardless of $\tau_c$, since it follows from the $G^2$ structure of the stochastic gravity noise propagation chain: stress-energy fluctuation $\xrightarrow{G}$ metric perturbation $\xrightarrow{G \cdot m}$ potential energy difference.

%======================================================================
\section{The Di\'osi--Penrose Rate Does Not Follow}
\label{sec:dp}
%======================================================================

The result of Section~\ref{sec:decoherence} has an important negative implication. The Di\'osi--Penrose decoherence timescale $\tau_{DP} = \hbar d / Gm^2$ is widely cited as a prediction of gravitational decoherence, and several experimental programs are designed to test it at mesoscopic scales~\cite{bose}. It is sometimes assumed, implicitly or explicitly, that this timescale follows from semiclassical gravity or from the self-consistency of the Einstein equation with quantum matter.

We have shown that it does not. The decoherence rate that follows from the semiclassical self-consistency equation plus its natural stochastic extension is suppressed by $(m/M_P)^2$ relative to the Di\'osi--Penrose rate. The origin of the suppression is clear: the noise in the stochastic extension comes from quantum fluctuations of $\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}$, whose gravitational effect is controlled by $G$. Converting this noise into a metric perturbation introduces a second factor of $G$, giving an overall rate proportional to $G^2$.

To obtain the Di\'osi--Penrose rate ($\propto G^1$), one must introduce noise at the level of the gravitational potential itself, not derived from quantum matter fluctuations. This is precisely what Di\'osi's model does~\cite{diosi}: it postulates a fundamental stochastic process in the Newtonian potential with a specific noise spectrum. Penrose's argument~\cite{penrose} arrives at the same timescale from a different route, invoking the ill-definedness of the time-translation operator for superposed geometries. Neither derivation follows from the semiclassical Einstein equation.

This sharpens the theoretical landscape:
\begin{itemize}
\item If gravitational decoherence is observed at the Di\'osi--Penrose rate, it cannot be explained by semiclassical self-consistency. Either gravity must be quantized, or a fundamentally new noise source (beyond quantum stress-energy fluctuations) must exist.
\item If gravitational decoherence is \emph{not} observed at the Di\'osi--Penrose rate in the accessible mass range ($m \sim 10^{-14}$~kg), this is consistent with the self-consistency framework but does not confirm it, since the framework's own decoherence rate is unobservably slow at these masses.
\item The experimental program testing Di\'osi--Penrose is therefore probing physics \emph{beyond} semiclassical gravity, regardless of its outcome.
\end{itemize}

%======================================================================
\section{Experimental Predictions}
\label{sec:experiment}
%======================================================================

\subsection{BMV Entanglement}

The Bose--Marletto--Vedral experiment~\cite{bose,marletto_vedral} places two masses in spatial superposition and tests for gravitational entanglement.

\begin{theorem}[Separability preservation---first-quantized matter]
In the linearized regime with first-quantized matter, semiclassical gravitational evolution preserves the separability of quantum states.
\end{theorem}

\noindent\emph{Proof.} For a product state $\rho = \rho_1 \otimes \rho_2$, the stress-energy decomposes as $\langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle = \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle_1 + \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle_2$. In the linearized Einstein equation, $h_{\mu\nu} = h^{(1)}_{\mu\nu} + h^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}$, and the Hamiltonian factorizes into single-particle operators plus a c-number interaction potential from the smeared distributions. A c-number potential cannot generate entanglement (LOCC theorem). The nonlinear correction is of order $Gm/c^2 D \sim 10^{-38}$ for BMV parameters. \hfill$\square$

When matter is described within full QFT, Aziz and Howl~\cite{aziz_howl} have shown that virtual matter propagators can transmit quantum information through a classical gravitational interaction, generating entanglement at fourth order in perturbation theory. The effect scales as $\vartheta \propto G^2 m^2 M^3 R \, t / \hbar^3 d$, suppressed relative to the quantum gravity prediction ($\varphi \propto GM^2 t / \hbar d$) by additional powers of mass.

\textbf{Prediction:} The BMV experiment will observe either (a)~no entanglement, or (b)~entanglement at the suppressed classical-gravity rate from virtual matter propagators. It will not observe entanglement at the rate predicted by quantum gravity. Observation of entanglement at the quantum gravity rate would falsify this framework.

This prediction is independent of the decoherence timescale and does not require the Di\'osi--Penrose rate.

\subsection{Gravitational Decoherence Experiments}

The framework predicts that experiments searching for gravitational decoherence at the Di\'osi--Penrose rate~\cite{diosi,penrose} will find no anomalous decoherence. The self-consistent decoherence rate (eq.~\ref{eq:gamma_sc}) is too slow to observe at any sub-Planckian mass.

This is a prediction that the Di\'osi--Penrose community would dispute, making it falsifiable in both directions. The critical test involves placing a mass $m \sim 10^{-14}$~kg in superposition of size $d \sim 100~\mu$m with all environmental decoherence suppressed:
\begin{itemize}
\item If fringe visibility decays on a timescale $\sim \hbar d / Gm^2 \approx 1.6$~s, the Di\'osi--Penrose models are supported and our framework is falsified.
\item If no anomalous decoherence is observed beyond environmental sources, the result is consistent with our framework.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distinguishing from Alternative Models}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Model & Decoherence rate & $m$-scaling & $G$-scaling \\
\midrule
This framework & $G^2 m^4 / (\hbar^2 c d)$ & $m^{4}$ & $G^2$ \\
Di\'osi--Penrose & $G m^2 / (\hbar d)$ & $m^{2}$ & $G$ \\
Kafri--Taylor--Milburn & $\sim G^2 m^3 / (\hbar D^5)$ & $m^{3}$ & $G^2$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The key discriminator is the $G$-scaling: models in which gravity introduces fundamental noise (Di\'osi, Penrose) predict rates proportional to $G^1$; models in which decoherence arises from quantum backreaction on classical geometry (this framework, KTM) predict $G^2$.

%======================================================================
\section{Relation to Existing Work}
%======================================================================

\textbf{Semiclassical gravity} (M\o ller, Rosenfeld): Our starting point. We treat the SCE and its stochastic extension as the sufficient description of gravity below the Planck scale, rather than an approximation to a deeper theory.

\textbf{Stochastic gravity} (Hu, Verdaguer~\cite{hu_verdaguer,phillips_hu}): The Einstein--Langevin equation is the natural fluctuation extension of our framework. Our decoherence calculation (Section~\ref{sec:decoherence}) is performed within this formalism.

\textbf{Penrose collapse}~\cite{penrose}: Predicts the same decoherence timescale as Di\'osi but from a different argument. Our framework shows this timescale does not follow from semiclassical self-consistency.

\textbf{Di\'osi model}~\cite{diosi}: Postulates fundamental gravitational noise at the Newtonian potential level. Our framework derives the noise from quantum stress-energy fluctuations, obtaining a rate suppressed by $(m/M_P)^2$.

\textbf{Postquantum classical gravity} (Oppenheim~\cite{oppenheim}): The most developed modern framework for classical-gravity-coupled-to-quantum-matter. Oppenheim derives a decoherence-diffusion trade-off that constrains any theory in which gravity couples to quantum matter through a classical channel. Our framework is not in this class: the noise kernel (eq.~\ref{eq:noise_kernel}) is a quantum object---the symmetrized two-point correlator of stress-energy fluctuations---and the stochastic metric fluctuations it sources are isomorphic to tree-level graviton exchange, not to a classical communication channel. The framework therefore escapes Oppenheim's trade-off rather than satisfying it. What the fixed-point analysis adds is a constructive existence proof with a quantitative contraction constant $\kappa \sim (m/M_P)^2$, giving a derived Planck-scale validity boundary rather than an imposed one. The null BMV prediction is shared between frameworks.

\textbf{Inflationary spectrum from stochastic gravity} (Roura, Verdaguer~\cite{roura_verdaguer}): Demonstrates that the stochastic gravity formalism reproduces the full spectrum of cosmological perturbations---scalar and tensor---without quantizing the metric. This removes a standard objection that semiclassical gravity cannot account for the inflationary perturbation spectrum, and supports the interpretation of the framework as tree-level quantum gravity.

\textbf{Classical gravity entanglement} (Aziz, Howl~\cite{aziz_howl}): Shows that QFT matter on a classical gravitational background can generate entanglement through virtual matter propagators. Compatible with our ontology.

\textbf{Page--Geilker experiment}~\cite{page_geilker}: Found that the gravitational field tracks definite measurement outcomes rather than expectation values. In our block-universe ontology (Axiom~3), this is expected: the global self-consistent solution includes the definite outcome.

%======================================================================
\section{Open Problems}
\label{sec:open}
%======================================================================

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Effective initial value formulation.} Axiom~3 states that the solution is global. Practical physics needs a local formulation---solving on patches and stitching together.

\item \textbf{Rigorous Schauder application.} The non-perturbative existence argument requires specifying the convex compact $\mathcal{F}$-invariant subset, including gauge fixing in Lorentzian signature.

\item \textbf{Precise noise kernel evaluation.} The decoherence rate in eq.~\eqref{eq:gamma_sc} is estimated from scaling arguments. A precise calculation using the noise kernel of Phillips and Hu~\cite{phillips_hu} for specific experimental geometries would sharpen the prediction. In particular, the rate for composite objects (e.g., microdiamonds with $N \sim 10^{12}$ atoms) is extrapolated from single-particle results assuming coherent center-of-mass superposition ($\Gamma \propto m_{\text{total}}^4$). This scaling is expected for rigid-body superpositions where all constituents move together, but a noise kernel calculation for extended objects would confirm the prefactor. The $G^2$ scaling and $(m/M_P)^2$ suppression are robust regardless of the prefactor.

\item \textbf{Macroscopic definiteness.} The framework does not currently derive the emergence of definite macroscopic outcomes from the self-consistency condition alone. The stochastic extension provides decoherence but at an unobservably slow rate. Whether the global constraint (Axiom~3) provides additional selection of definite outcomes remains open.

\item \textbf{Black hole evaporation and the Page time.} The framework inherits the Hawking calculation, which predicts monotonically increasing radiation entropy. For large black holes---where curvature is small and $\kappa \ll 1$, well within the framework's stated validity domain---this conflicts with unitarity at the Page time~\cite{page_curve}. The island formula~\cite{penington,aemm} resolves this via topology-changing saddles in the gravitational path integral, but topology change amounts to summing over geometries, which the framework does not include.

This reveals that the framework's validity requires two conditions, not one: (a)~$\kappa \ll 1$ (quantum backreaction is perturbatively small), and (b)~the observable in question must be computable on a single spacetime topology. The Page curve violates condition~(b) despite satisfying condition~(a). We regard this as the sharpest limitation of the tree-level description. Condition~(b) is not self-diagnosable: determining whether topology change contributes to a given observable requires the full theory of quantum gravity, which the framework does not provide.

\item \textbf{Lorentzian signature and conformal symmetry breaking.} The physical content of the timelike direction---rest frames, proper time, timelike geodesics---depends entirely on the existence of massive fields. In a purely conformal universe with no symmetry breaking, the $(-,+,+,+)$ signature would have no observable consequences: no field would have a rest frame and no proper time could be defined for any physical degree of freedom. This observation appears in Penrose's conformal cyclic cosmology~\cite{penrose_ccc}, where the far-future decay of all massive particles renders the timelike/null distinction physically irrelevant. Wheeler~\cite{wheeler_biconformal} has shown, conversely, that gauging the conformal group $SO(4,2)$ on Euclidean space dynamically produces Lorentzian signature on submanifolds. Whether the self-consistency fixed point of Section~\ref{sec:fixedpoint} \emph{requires} Lorentzian signature when the field content includes massive fields---i.e., whether the Banach contraction fails on a Riemannian manifold---is an open question that connects the present framework to these programs.
\end{enumerate}

%======================================================================
\section{Summary}
%======================================================================

We have developed the consequences of a single thesis: physical law is self-consistency, and gravity is the constraint that enforces it. The semiclassical Einstein equation and its stochastic extension implement this constraint at tree level. The block spacetime---the complete four-dimensional solution---is the ontology.

The mathematical content of this thesis is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Self-consistent solutions exist} with quantitative control---exactly in cosmology, perturbatively near all classical solutions with contraction constant $\kappa \sim (m/M_P)^2 \ll 1$, and conditionally in the general case. The Planck scale emerges as the natural validity boundary where $\kappa \to 1$.

\item \textbf{The Di\'osi--Penrose decoherence rate does not follow from self-consistency.} The stochastic extension yields a rate suppressed by $(m/M_P)^2$, arising from the $G^2$ scaling of gravitationally mediated quantum noise. Observation of gravitational decoherence at the Di\'osi--Penrose rate would require physics beyond the semiclassical Einstein equation.

\item \textbf{BMV entanglement experiments will not observe entanglement at the quantum gravity rate.} Semiclassical evolution preserves separability at the first-quantized level; QFT corrections allow only a suppressed channel distinguishable from quantum gravity predictions.
\end{enumerate}

The framework is falsifiable: observation of BMV entanglement at the quantum gravity rate, or gravitational decoherence at the Di\'osi--Penrose rate, would refute it. Its sharpest known limitation is black hole evaporation past the Page time, where topology change---absent from the tree-level description---becomes essential (Section~\ref{sec:open}).
